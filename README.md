## smartmeter-ir-reader

This is an implementation of the smart reader concept created by [volkszaehler.org](https://wiki.volkszaehler.org/hardware/controllers/ir-schreib-lesekopf-ttl-ausgang).

It has been modified as follows:

- Replaced 13k resistors by 10k (as I have a lot of them in stock)
- Added an RJ11 connector with 4 pins as a connector to the microcontroller unit

This board is intended to interface with a Microcontroller unit via an RJ11 connector.

## Revision History:
- **v1.0**: Initial version (Produced: 19.08.2023; First Assembly: 06.10.2023)
- **v1.1**: Corrected RJ12 socket connector
